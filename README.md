# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using LSTM

## 📘 Project Overview
This project performs sentiment classification on tweets using an LSTM-based neural network. The goal is to classify tweets into **Negative**, **Neutral**, or **Positive** sentiments.

## 📁 Dataset
- [Sentiment140 on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## 🔧 Steps to Run
1. Upload your Kaggle `kaggle.json` to Colab
2. Run the dataset download and extraction commands
3. Follow the Colab notebook step-by-step for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation

## 📊 Outputs
- Confusion Matrix to visualize predictions
- Accuracy and loss plots to evaluate model performance

## 📌 Highlights
- Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)
- LSTM for sequence modeling
- Model evaluation with test accuracy and confusion matrix
